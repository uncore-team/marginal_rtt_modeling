This repository contains the official MATLAB implementation of the methods presented in the paper:

> **"Goodness-of-fit in the Marginal Modeling of Round-Trip Times for Networked Robot Sensor Transmissions"**

This is a development of the [TYRELL](https://babel.isa.uma.es/research/projects/tyrell/) research project.

When a mobile robot cannot perform certain computations onboard, it must transmit sensory data to a remote station for processing. The resulting actions are sent back to the robot, forming a control loop. This introduces **stochastic round-trip times** due to non-deterministic network behavior or non-real-time software.

Because robots often operate under strict timing constraints, modeling these delays is essential. While **time series forecasting** methods are common, they can be **computationally expensive**, **unsuitable for online use**, fail to account for **all delay sources** in complex systems or do not provide **enough information in their models** (or not model at all) to make relevant decisions.

This work proposes an alternative: **marginal probabilistic modeling** of round-trip times, which ignores temporal dependencies under the assumption that **regime changes** can be detected using statistical tests. We focus on hypothesis testing for regime modeling and change detection, and adapt three classical distributions‚Äî**Log-logistic**, **Log-normal**, and **Exponential**‚Äîto this setting. We introduce improvements in parameter estimation and goodness-of-fit tests tailored to real-world robotic data.

Over **2150 hours** of computing time have been devoted to validate our approach, demonstrating both statistical robustness and practical suitability for real-time applications.
